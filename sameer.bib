@article{zhang2008an,
	Abstract = {Complex diseases are presumed to be the results of interactions of several genes and environmental factors, with each gene only having a small effect on the disease. Thus, the methods that can account for gene-gene interactions to search for a set of marker loci in different genes or across genome and to analyze these loci jointly are critical. In this article, we propose an ensemble learning approach (ELA) to detect a set of loci whose main and interaction effects jointly have a significant association with the trait. In the ELA, we first search for "base learners" and then combine the effects of the base learners by a linear model. Each base learner represents a main effect or an interaction effect. The result of the ELA is easy to interpret. When the ELA is applied to analyze a data set, we can get a final model, an overall P-value of the association test between the set of loci involved in the final model and the trait, and an importance measure for each base learner and each marker involved in the final model. The final model is a linear combination of some base learners. We know which base learner represents a main effect and which one represents an interaction effect. The importance measure of each base learner or marker can tell us the relative importance of the base learner or marker in the final model. We used intensive simulation studies as well as a real data set to evaluate the performance of the ELA. Our simulation studies demonstrated that the ELA is more powerful than the single-marker test in all the simulation scenarios. The ELA also outperformed the other three existing multi-locus methods in almost all cases. In an application to a large-scale case-control study for Type 2 diabetes, the ELA identified 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms that have a significant multi-locus effect (P-value=0.01), while none of the single nucleotide polymorphisms showed significant marginal effects and none of the two-locus combinations showed significant two-locus interaction effects. },

	Abstract = {We present a framework for learning abstract relational knowledge
	with the aim of explaining how people acquire intuitive theories
	of physical, biological, or social systems. Our approach is based
	on a generative relational model with latent classes, and simultaneously
	determines the kinds of entities that exist in a domain, the number
	of these latent classes, and the relations between classes that are
	possible or likely. This model goes beyond previous psychological
	models of category learning, which consider attributes associated
	with individual categories but not relationships between categories.
	We apply this domain-general framework to two specific problems:
	learning the structure of kinship systems and learning causal theories.},

@article{christen05:markov,
	Abstract = {This article presents a method for generating samples from an unnormalized posterior distribution f(·) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in which the evaluation of f(·) is very difficult or computationally demanding. Commonly, a less computationally demanding, perhaps local, approximation to f(·) is available, say $f_{x}^{\ast}\ $(·). An algorithm is proposed to generate an MCMC that uses such an approximation to calculate acceptance probabilities at each step of a modified Metropolis--Hastings algorithm. Once a proposal is accepted using the approximation, f(·) is calculated with full precision ensuring convergence to the desired distribution. We give sufficient conditions for the algorithm to converge to f(·) and give both theoretical and practical justifications for its usage. Typical applications are in inverse problems using physical data models where computing time is dominated by complex model simulation. We outline Bayesian inference and computing for inverse problems. A stylized example is given of recovering resistor values in a network from electrical measurements made at the boundary. Although this inverse problem has appeared in studies of underground reservoirs, it has primarily been chosen for pedagogical value because model simulation has precisely the same computational structure as a finite element method solution of the complete electrode model used in conductivity imaging, or "electrical impedance tomography." This example shows a dramatic decrease in CPU time, compared to a standard Metropolis---Hastings algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Most methods for object class segmentation are formulated as a labelling problem over a single choice of quantisation of an image space - pixels, segments or group of segments. It is well known that each quantisation has its fair share of pros and cons; and the existence of a common optimal quantisation level suitable for all object categories is highly unlikely. Motivated by this observation, we propose a hierarchical random field model, that allows integration of features computed at different levels of the quantisation hierarchy. MAP inference in this model can be performed efficiently using powerful graph cut based move making algorithms. Our framework generalises much of the previous work based on pixels or segments. We evaluate its efficiency on some of the most challenging data-sets for object class segmentation, and show it obtains state-of-the-art results.},
