	Abstract = {Hedging is a well-documented feature of spoken discourse as a result of its role in qualifying categorical commitment and facilitating discussion Its use in academic writing has received less attention, however, and we know little about the functions it serves in different research fields and particular genres Hedging is a significant communicative resource for academics since it both confirms the individual's professional persona and represents a critical element in the rhetorical means of gaining acceptance of claims Hedges allow writers to anticipate possible opposition to claims by expressing statements with precision, caution, and diplomatic deference to the views of colleagues Based on a contextual analysis of 26 articles in molecular biology, this paper argues that hedging in scientific research writing cannot be fully understood in isolation from social and institutional contexts and suggests a pragmatic framework which reflects this interpretive environment 10.1093/applin/17.4.433},

	Abstract = {<p>We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly<br />many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for<br />these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning to<br />take advantage of the potential speed up. In this paper, we develop a broadly ap-<br />plicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to many different<br />learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the tradition in machine<br />learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up a single algorithm at a<br />time. Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit the Statistical Query model [15]<br />can be written in a certain {\textquotedblleft}summation form,{\textquotedblright} which allows them to be easily par-<br />allelized on multicore computers. We adapt Google{\textquoteright}s map-reduce [7] paradigm to<br />demonstrate this parallel speed up technique on a variety of learning algorithms<br />including locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regres-<br />sion (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM, ICA, PCA, gaussian discriminant analysis<br />(GDA), EM, and backpropagation (NN). Our experimental results show basically<br />linear speedup with an increasing number of processors.</p>},

	the widely used hidden Markov model. Our paper introduces a new inference
	algorithm for the infinite Hidden Markov model called beam sampling.
	Beam sampling combines slice sampling, which limits the number of
	states considered at each time step to a finite number, with dynamic
	programming, which samples whole state trajectories efficiently.
	Our algorithm typically outperforms the Gibbs sampler and is more
	robust. We present applications of {iHMM} inference using the beam
	sampler on changepoint detection and text prediction problems.},

@article{kim08geniaevent,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Advanced Text Mining (TM) such as semantic enrichment of
	papers, event or relation extraction, and intelligent Question Answering
	have increasingly attracted attention in the bio-medical domain.
	For such attempts to succeed, text annotation from the biological
	point of view is indispensable. However, due to the complexity of
	the task, semantic annotation has never been tried on a large scale,
	apart from relatively simple term annotation.RESULTS:We have completed
	a new type of semantic annotation, event annotation, which is an
	addition to the existing annotations in the GENIA corpus. The corpus
	has already been annotated with POS (Parts of Speech), syntactic
	trees, terms, etc. The new annotation was made on half of the GENIA
	corpus, consisting of 1,000 Medline abstracts. It contains 9,372
	sentences in which 36,114 events are identified. The major challenges
	during event annotation were (1) to design a scheme of annotation
	which meets specific requirements of text annotation, (2) to achieve
	biology-oriented annotation which reflect biologists' interpretation
	of text, and (3) to ensure the homogeneity of annotation quality
	across annotators. To meet these challenges, we introduced new concepts
	such as Single-facet Annotation and Semantic Typing, which have collectively
	contributed to successful completion of a large scale annotation.CONCLUSION:The
	resulting event-annotated corpus is the largest and one of the best
	in quality among similar annotation efforts. We expect it to become
	a valuable resource for NLP (Natural Language Processing)-based TM
	in the bio-medical domain.},

@article{krallinger08biocreative2ppi,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND::The biomedical literature is the primary information source
	for manual protein-protein interaction annotations. Text-mining systems
	have been implemented to extract binary protein interactions from
	articles, but a comprehensive comparison between the different techniques
	as well as with manual curation was missing.RESULTS::We designed
	a community challenge, the BioCreative II protein-protein interaction
	(PPI) task, based on the main steps of a manual protein interaction
	annotation workflow. It was structured into four distinct subtasks
	related to: (a) detection of protein interaction-relevant articles;
	(b) extraction and normalization of protein interaction pairs; (c)
	retrieval of the interaction detection methods used; and (d) retrieval
	of actual text passages that provide evidence for protein interactions.
	A total of 26 teams submitted runs for at least one of the proposed
	subtasks. In the interaction article detection subtask, the top scoring
	team reached an F-score of 0.78. In the interaction pair extraction
	and mapping to SwissProt, a precision of 0.37 (with recall of 0.33)
	was obtained. For associating articles with an experimental interaction
	detection method, an F-score of 0.65 was achieved. As for the retrieval
	of the PPI passages best summarizing a given protein interaction
	in full-text articles, 19% of the submissions returned by one of
	the runs corresponded to curator-selected sentences. Curators extracted
	only the passages that best summarized a given interaction, implying
	that many of the automatically extracted ones could contain interaction
	information but did not correspond to the most informative sentences.CONCLUSION::The
	BioCreative II PPI task is the first attempt to compare the performance
	of text-mining tools specific for each of the basic steps of the
	PPI extraction pipeline. The challenges identified range from problems
	in full-text format conversion of articles to difficulties in detecting
	interactor protein pairs and then linking them to their database
	records. Some limitations were also encountered when using a single
	(and possibly incomplete) reference database for protein normalization
	or when limiting search for interactor proteins to co-occurrence
	within a single sentence, when a mention might span neighboring sentences.
	Finally, distinguishing between novel, experimentally verified interactions
	(annotation relevant) and previously known interactions adds additional
	complexity to these tasks.},

@article{blei03lda,
	Abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},
